1. Machine Learning Lifecycle:
The machine learning lifecycle is a process that guides the development and deployment of machine learning models in a structured way. It consists of various steps.

Each step plays a crucial role in ensuring the success and effectiveness of the machine learning solution. By following the machine learning lifecycle, organizations can solve complex problems systematically, leverage data-driven insights, and create scalable and sustainable machine learning solutions that deliver tangible value. The steps to be followed in the machine learning lifecycle are:
01. Problem Definition
02. Data Collection
03. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
04. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
05. Feature Engineering and Selection
06. Model Selection
07.  Model Training
08. Model Evaluation and Tuning
09. Model Deployment
10. Model Monitoring and Maintenance
