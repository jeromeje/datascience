Types of Supervised Learning in Machine Learning
Now, Supervised learning can be applied to two main types of problems:

Classification: Where the output is a categorical variable (e.g., spam vs. non-spam emails, yes vs. no).
Regression: Where the output is a continuous variable (e.g., predicting house prices, stock prices).
