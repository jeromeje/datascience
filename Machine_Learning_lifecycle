Machine Learning Lifecycle
The machine learning lifecycle is a process that guides the development and deployment of machine learning models in a structured way. It consists of various steps.

Each step plays a crucial role in ensuring the success and effectiveness of the machine learning solution. By following the machine learning lifecycle, organizations can solve complex problems systematically, leverage data-driven insights, and create scalable and sustainable machine learning solutions that deliver tangible value. The steps to be followed in the machine learning lifecycle are:

1. Problem Definition
2. Data Collection
3. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
5. Feature Engineering and Selection
6. Model Selection
7. Model Training
8. Model Evaluation and Tuning
9. Model Deployment
10. Model Monitoring and Maintenance
